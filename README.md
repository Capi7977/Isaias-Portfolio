# Isaias-Portfolio
1. I creates my html files, css file, and my js file
Throughout this project the first thing that I have done is creates branches so that i can commit to all my links.

A few days later I was able to just start off with just the htmls and css for each html file. I was doing this while not getting anything else complicated. 

After completing the html and the css I was now able to git add and push to git hub. At first it was very confusing but later I was able to somewhat get the hang of it. 

After dong the pull request ive also added images and doublecheck my work because on my first website i would git push but the later all my work was gone.

Now that I am finished I can finnaly submit my work and focuse on my other work withis creating form and having more prectices. I may not have a lot of time due to work but I am alwyas willing to stay up all night because I do belive this is my way out from my other job and have a better career.
